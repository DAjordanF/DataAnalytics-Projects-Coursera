# Summary of Steps Involved in the Cyclistic Bike-Sharing Analytics:

##### 1. Understanding the Company: Get familiar with Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company in Chicago, operating since 2016. They have 692 stations and 5,824 bicycles equipped with lock and geotracking tools. Two types of memberships are available: casual rider and annual member.

##### 2. Define the Scenario: The objective is to analyze how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. The insights gained will be used to create a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

##### 3. Obtain Datasets: Utilize 1-year Cyclistic riding data from November 2021 to October 2022 for analysis. The datasets are available for use.

##### 4. Selecting Tools: Three primary tools are employed for this project:
a. R: Used to load, clean, transform, and analyze the data. Separate R-files are created for each month's dataset due to its large size.
b. Microsoft Excel: Used to save outputs from R and create tables for further analysis and reporting.
c. Microsoft Power BI: Used to create visualizations and generate reports based on the insights gained from the data analysis.

##### 5. Utilize R Code: R is utilized to perform data analysis. The 12 monthly datasets are analyzed separately using individual R-files, but only one R-file is uploaded here as they have the same code except for the dataset file name.
Libraries: Two R libraries are utilized for the analysis:
a. Tidyverse: Used for general data analysis tasks.
b. Lubridate: Used for date and time analysis.
##### 6. Analysis: With the help of R and the selected libraries, analyze each monthly dataset to uncover patterns and trends in how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes.
##### 7. Visualization and Reporting: The insights gained from the analysis are used to create visualizations and reports. Microsoft Power BI is employed for this purpose. Although Tableau was recommended for this project, the analyst prefers using Power BI based on their experience. However, the difference in visualization and reporting capabilities between Tableau and Power BI is stated to be minimal.
